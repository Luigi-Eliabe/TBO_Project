This is a repository for my final project in a class on College, along with [felkng](https://github.com/Felkng).

The program is based on receiving a .txt file, find all misspelled words from it by using a [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) and [KMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm), and autocorrect them by using and [edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) algorithm.
